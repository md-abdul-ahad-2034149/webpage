        <p>In this course, i’ll learn all about becoming a web developer, from the responsibilities that a web developer performs on a day-to-day basis to the set of skills that you’d need to succeed in such a role. And, of course, i’ll also get your hands dirty with code: jhonkar’ll introduce you to the fundamental building blocks of the web and make sure i leave this course having developed my very first website</p>
